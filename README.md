Automate an Iris tool and reduce manual work, Python script is created that leverages libraries like Selenium, Pandas, and Openpyxl.

Hereâ€™s the approach I followed:

1) Identify the tasks you want to automate within the TCS tool.
2) Map out the workflow of these tasks to understand the sequence of actions needed.
3) Use Selenium to interact with web elements if the tool is web-based:
 Navigate pages, click buttons, fill out forms, writing scripts etc.
4) Apply Pandas for data manipulation tasks:
 Read data from various sources, aggregate, and process data.
5) Utilize Openpyxl to read from and write to Excel files if needed:
 Useful for reports generation.
